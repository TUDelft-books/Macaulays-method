# Getting paid for open-source contributions

In case you'd like to contribute to the SymPy code, which can be used to do calculations like this, you can get paid for your programming contribution! The Google Summer of Code initiative is organized by [Google](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), and [SymPy](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/organizations/sympy) participates in it. See instructions [here](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-Student-Instructions) on how to apply.
